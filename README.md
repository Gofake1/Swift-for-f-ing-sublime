# Swift-for-f-ing-sublime

Based on the built-in Java language definition, so it doesn't suck.

I was very disappointed in the other Swift language definitions out there, so I
modified the Java definitions to work in Swift.

I added support for `// MARK: ...`, and `func / protocol / nil` keywords, and
not much else.  Pretty much "just worked" out of the box.
